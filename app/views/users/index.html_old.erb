<!-- The will_paginate method is a little magical; inside a users view, it automatically looks 
for an @users object, and then displays pagination links to access other pages. 
The view in Listing 9.34 doesnâ€™t work yet, though, because currently @users contains the results of User.all 
(Listing 9.24), which is of class Array, whereas will_paginate expects an object of class ActiveRecord::Relation. 
Happily, this is just the kind of object returned by the paginate method added by the will_paginate gem to all Active Record objects: -->
